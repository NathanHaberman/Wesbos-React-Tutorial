Some notes about the course:

State:
======
State lives in your App component and is tied to the Firebase

Props:
======
Parent Components pass variables, functions, etc to their children, these live in props on the children.

Router:
=======
Routes point to what component should be rendered.

<Route exact path="/" component={*component*} />
  > exact: matches exactly

<Route path="/somePath/:*variable*" component={*component*} />
  > :*variable* passes the variable to the component via props.match.*variable*
